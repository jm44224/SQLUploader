SQL Uploader

SCOPE
The intent of this project was to take a single SQL script, upload it to multiple databases on the same server, and provide feedback to the user.

HISTORY
This project was created in March 2007. I originally wrote it in VB.NET in prior years, but needed to refresh my C#.NET skills, as I was changing employers. It was customized over the next few years to meet the needs of my employer at that time. Since then, it has become dormant and unused.
